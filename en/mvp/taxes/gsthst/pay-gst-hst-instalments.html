        <h2 id="htp"><strong>Find out if you need to&nbsp;pay GST/HST by instalments</strong></h2>
 <p>If you are an annual filer and your net tax for a fiscal year is&nbsp;$3,000 or more, you may have to make quarterly instalment payments throughout the following fiscal year. If this is the first time you are filing, there are special rules for calculating GST/HST installments and whether you must make them.</p>  
	<p>If your business has branches or divisions that file separate returns, the threshold limit applies to the total net tax for the whole business, including all branches and divisions.</p>  

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="clc"><strong>How to calculate your GST/HST instalment payments</strong></h3>
 <p>You can calculate your instalment payments online. To use the instalment payment calculator service, see <a href="../e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> or <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a client</a>. The following determines how to calculate your GST/HST instalment payments based on your situation:</p>  
	<ul> 
		<li><a href="#spr">Special rules for the first time you file</a></li>
		<li><a href="#pmtpy">Base your instalment payments on the previous year</a></li> 
		<li><a href="#pmtcy">Base your instalment payments on the current year</a></li>
	 </ul>  
    


</div>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="spr"><strong>Special rules for the first time you file</strong></h4>
 <p>If you are a <strong>new registrant</strong> and an annual filer, you may have to make instalment payments during your next fiscal year even if your net tax is less than $3,000. This could happen if your first year of filing for GST/HST is less than a full fiscal year. To determine if you need to do this, estimate what your net tax will be for your next fiscal year by prorating your net tax from your short fiscal year.</p>  <p>Divide the net tax for the first short fiscal year by the number of days that you were registered in that fiscal year. Then multiply this amount by 365.</p>  <p>If the estimated amount is $3,000 or more, and your net tax for the next fiscal year will be $3,000 or more, you will need to make instalment payments in the next year.</p>  <p>If your net tax for the current or previous year is <strong>less than</strong> $3,000, you do not need to make quarterly instalment payments in the current year. In this case, you need to file your GST/HST return and send us any GST/HST owing once a year.</p>

        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>You are a sole proprietor. Your first year as an annual filer began on December 12, 2016, and ended on December 31, 2016. Your net tax for those 20 days was $200. To determine if you need to make instalment payments in 2017, prorate your net tax for 2016 as follows:</p>
<p>$200 (net tax) ÷ 20 (days) × 365 = $3,650</p>
<p>Since your prorated 2016 net tax is greater than the $3,000 or more threshold, you will need to make equal quarterly instalment payments in 2017 if your 2017 net tax will also be $3,000. To base your instalment payments on your prorated 2016 net tax, calculate the amount of each payment as follows:</p>
<p>$3,650 ÷ 4 = $912.50</p>
<p>You have two payments due on April 30, 2017, both your net tax of $200 for 2016 and your first instalment for 2017 of $912.50.</p>

We will calculate your quarterly instalments at $1,000 each ($4,000 ÷ 4). However, if you choose to base your instalments on your estimate for 2015, you can make quarterly payments of $800 ($3,200 ÷ 4). Your first instalment is due April 30, 2015.
